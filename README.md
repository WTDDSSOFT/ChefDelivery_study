# 🍽️ ChefDelivery

**ChefDelivery** is a SwiftUI project focused on **building reusable, modular UI components** for a modern food delivery app interface. This project serves as a UI/UX foundation with clearly separated views and component-based structure — without relying on any specific architectural pattern like MVVM.

## 🎯 Project Focus

- 🧩 **Component-First Development**: Focused on building and previewing SwiftUI components in isolation.
- 🧪 **Mock Data Integration**: Fast UI prototyping using mocked data sources.
- 🛠️ **No Architecture Layering**: No MVVM, Redux, or Coordinator pattern — just clean SwiftUI views.

## ✨ Key UI Components

- 🔁 `CarouselUlView`: Horizontal scrollable UI for promotions or banners
- 📦 `GridUIView` + `StoreItemView`: Grid layout for products or restaurants
- 🧭 `NavigationBarUlView`: Custom navigation header
- 🗂 `OrderTypeGridUlView`: Grid-based category selector
